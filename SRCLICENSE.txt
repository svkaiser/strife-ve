Compiling on Win32:
-------------------

A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 is provided in 
msvc/chocolate.sln 
The solution file is compatible with the Express releases.

Compiling on MacOS 10.x:
-------------------

A project file for XCode is provided in xcode/Chocolate/Strife-VE.xcodeproj
All dependencies and settings should already be set inside the workspace.

Compiling on Linux:
-------------------

A CMake build system has been added in version 1.3, and is currently up-to-date.

A project file for Codeblocks is provided in codeblocks/chocolate.workspace
Before compiling, be sure to compile patchelf first by going into the patchelf/
directory and then running configure and then make. The project has not been
updated for 1.3, so some source files may need to be added before you can 
build successfully.

Codeblocks uses a post-build step that calls patchelf to set up runtime paths
for the output executable.
